# 🧠 netsci_toolkit
*A lightweight Network Science toolkit implemented from scratch.*

This package contains **core algorithms for network analysis**, implemented entirely from scratch and inspired by educational materials from the online textbook  
**“Network Science” by Brennan Klein** → [https://brennanklein.com/network-science-data-textbook](https://brennanklein.com/network-science-data-textbook).

It includes:
- Custom implementations of **centrality measures** (closeness, eigenvector);
- **Random graph generation** models (degree-preserving randomization, configuration model);
- **Community detection algorithms** (Girvan–Newman and Louvain);
- Helper functions for **modularity computation** and **hierarchical aggregation**.
